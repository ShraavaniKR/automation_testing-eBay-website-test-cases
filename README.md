This Selenium automation project is designed to enhance the efficiency of web
interactions and data extraction on the eBay platform. The core objective of the script is to
automate the process of searching for a specific product—namely, the "Apple iPhone 15
Pro Max"—and retrieving its delivery details. Upon initiating a web browser and navigating
to eBay's homepage, the script inputs the search term into the search box and submits the
query. It then identifies and selects a particular product from the search results, which opens
in a new browser tab. 
The script effectively handles multiple windows or tabs, switches to the new tab,
and extracts key delivery information from the product details page. Additionally, the 
script attempts to add the product to the cart, demonstrating its capability to interact with
dynamic web elements and perform user actions.
This automation showcases the application of Selenium WebDriver for end-to-end
web automation, emphasizing best practices such as handling multiple windows, waiting 
for elements to be interactable, and extracting specific data. By automating these tasks, the 
project not only illustrates the power of Selenium in web testing but also offers insights 
into practical implementations for improving web-based processes and user experience.
